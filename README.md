### Push_Swap
#### Abstract: 
Design of a sorting algorithm using two stacks and a limited set of operations. This project was a challenge in algorithmic optimization, forcing me to find efficient solutions for sorting data with strict constraints.
#### Skills acquired:
* Development of efficient sorting algorithms.
* Creative use of data structures to solve complex problems.
